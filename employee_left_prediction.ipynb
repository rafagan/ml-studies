    "## Why Removing Outliers is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing **outliers** (extreme values) is important for several reasons — especially when working with **statistical or machine learning models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 1. Models Get Confused by Extreme Values\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many algorithms (like linear regression, neural networks, or SVMs) **assume that the data has a reasonably normal distribution**.\n",
    "- Outliers pull the mean and coefficients toward extremes, **distorting the model’s learning**.\n",
    "- **Example**: An employee who worked 1000 hours in a month is likely a typo — but it might make the model think that \"more hours\" always means \"lower chance of leaving.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 2. Improves Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean data helps models **generalize better** on new data (reduces overfitting).\n",
    "- Outliers can prevent the model from detecting real patterns and instead make it \"learn\" from exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 3. Stabilizes Statistics Like Mean and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many descriptive statistics are **very sensitive to outliers** (mean, variance, etc.).\n",
    "- Removing them allows your metrics to better summarize the typical behavior of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 4. Helps Identify Errors or Inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outliers are not always “bad” — but when they appear, they **deserve investigation**:\n",
    "  - A `satisfaction_level = 0.01` may be legitimate (someone truly dissatisfied), or a data entry error.\n",
    "  - A `time_spend_company = 50` might indicate **a mistake or system error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 5. Reduces Noise and Improves Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Charts like histograms or boxplots become clearer without extreme values stretching the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚫 Exception\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **some fields (like fraud detection, predictive maintenance, etc.)**, the outliers are **exactly what you want to find**. In these cases, you **should not remove them**, but instead analyze them carefully."

    "## 📊 Z-Score Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Z-score** is a statistical measurement that describes a value's position relative to the mean of a group of values. It is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "$Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x` = the value being evaluated\n",
    "- `μ` = the mean of the dataset\n",
    "- `σ` = the standard deviation of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we are analyzing salaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean salary (μ) = 50,000\n",
    "- Standard deviation (σ) = 5,000\n",
    "- One employee earns (x) = 60,000\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the formula:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Z = (60,000 - 50,000) / 5,000\n",
    "Z = 10,000 / 5,000\n",
    "Z = 2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Z-score of **2.0** means that this salary is **2 standard deviations above the average**. This is not considered an outlier (which typically would require a Z-score > 3 or < -3), but it does indicate that the value is relatively high.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why is Z-score useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It helps detect **outliers** in a dataset.\n",
    "- It **normalizes values**, allowing comparison across different scales.\n",
    "- It's commonly used in **standardization** before machine learning models."

    "#### ⚠️ Why It Matters\n",
    "- It reduces the interpretability of coefficients in linear models.\n",
    "- It increases the variance of model parameters, making predictions unstable.\n",
    "- It may cause overfitting in models sensitive to input redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Key Notes\n",
    "- **Non-linear models** like **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Neural Networks** are generally **less affected** by multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Always **check for null values**, as missing data can interfere with correlation inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧪 How to Detect Multicollinearity\n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation Matrix**: Identify variables with correlation > 0.8 or 0.9.\n",
    "- **Heatmaps**: Visualize correlations for easier interpretation.\n",
    "- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Quantifies how much variance is inflated due to multicollinearity. Remove features with VIF > 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧾 Common Examples of Correlated Variables\n",
    "- `height` and `arm span`: Usually strongly correlated in biological data.\n",
    "- `engine size` and `horsepower`: In vehicle specs, both increase together.\n",
    "- `monthly income` and `years of experience`: Typically rise in tandem in job-related datasets.\n",
    "- `number_project` and `average_monthly_hours`: In HR datasets, more projects often mean more work hours.\n",
    "- `temperature` and `ice cream sales`: Seasonal correlation in marketing data."
